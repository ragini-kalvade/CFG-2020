# team-23 SMS-SE PADHO
# # What It Does:
 Our project is a one-stop, interactive website for teachers. With SMS-SePadho, teachers can avoid the hassle of sending assignments from multiple platforms. Our website will handle it all. It will also evaluate all submissions and analyze every studentâ€™s performance.
# #Inspiration:
The Better Education Foundation strives to provide better education to the underserved. Covid-19 has demanded every service to search for online replacements. With less privileged students, we face different issues of no/lack of access to smartphones and access to different platforms added with a limited technology exposure of all those involved. To overcome these we were inspired to create a platform wherein updating any information sends broadcasts to all the platforms that different students have access to.
# #How we built it:
Django, Javascript, HTML,CSS, Bootstrap, Python Libraries like Numpy, matplotlib
# #Challenges we ran into:
integrations of different features.
# #Accomplishments that we are proud of:
We all learnt something new. Got to work for NGOs and coded for social good and tried to make a change. We tried to reach out urban poor students and tried to provide the best way of education. We achieved this by sending the study material via SMS.
# #Future Scope for our Project:
Proper integrations of all features for smooth functioning, A mobile App for better reach and students with smarthphone can have better access.
